zipped_train = zip(word1_train, word2_train, label_train)
random.shuffle(zipped_train)
word1_train, word2_train, label_train= zip(*zipped_train)

In python 3.6: need to convert to list:
We convert the zip object to a list by list(zipped). After this we can use all the methods of list.

x = [1, 2, 3,5,7,9]
y = [4, 5, 6,8,10,12]
zipped = list(zip(x, y))
random.shuffle(zipped)
x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
print(x2)
print(y2)
(3, 7, 9, 2, 5, 1)
(6, 10, 12, 5, 8, 4)
